<span class="sub">LOVED IT: Solid visuals, nice courses . . . and you get to do more than race<br/>HATED IT: Sound can be shaky, noticeable rubber-banding<br/>GRAB IT IF: You loved 'Mario Kart,'' or four-player split-screen multiplayer - or both
</span><br/><br/>      
<span class="date">July 11, 2011 </span><br/> <br/> 
<span class="copy">By Ebenezer Samuel <br/>Daily News Staff Writer</span><br/> <br/>     
<span class="copy">Swap Lightning McQueen for Super Mario, change cartoony cars into go-karts, slap a Nintendo label on it and "Cars 2: The Video Game" could easily be confused for the latest iteration of "Super Mario Kart."<br/> <br/>  
And that's definitely not a bad thing. Developer Avalanche's latest movie tie-in game channels an old-school soul and that's a big reason why it's actually, well, fun. Unlike other movie tie-ins (cough, "Transformers: Dark of the Moon," cough), "Cars 2" doesn't try to stuff itself into some random, nonsensical 3D platformer/shooter package and it isn't overly concerned with replicating its source material. Avalanche did something even better: It simply made a FUN game. <br/> <br/>  
This is a kart racer that steals a few elements from other hot-shot racing games and draws children in. "Gran Turismo" vets need not apply, but children will be drawn to the "Cars 2" name.
Avalanche gives you a robust collection of 20 cars, meaning you get all the big names from Pixar's hit, plus a host of anonymous characters that only my niece would actually recognize. You'll tire of each character's handful of fully voiced quips after just a few races, but the vehicle models look excellent and feature a surprising amount of lighting effects. <br/> <br/>  
All that setup feels distinctly "Cars 2," but the rest of the gameplay is largely stripped from classic kart racer. You'll careen through three-lap race after three-lap race and, after a handful of brief tutorials to teach the racing ropes (these seem more meant for young kids than anyone else), you're introduced to the idea of - wait for it - random question-mark powerups. <br/> <br/>  
Everything you'd expect from a kart racer - from oil slicks to missiles to electric-type bombs - is available for your racing pleasure, each with some kind of spy-car feel . Avalanche also injects a few other additions, too, letting you fill a speed boost meter by showboating.  <br/> <br/>  
Showboat moves are controlled with the right stick. You'll find yourself trying to flip your car during jumps, skating around turns on two wheels, even driving backwards - all in hopes of filling a tiny meter and gaining extra speed.    <br/> <br/>  
That extra juice is hardly essential in single-player mode, because "Cars 2" has some ultra-friendly A.I. It's a kid's game, right? So that must be why you can spend the first two laps of a race trailing, then almost inexplicably cross the final finish line in first place.  <br/> <br/>  
Thankfully, "Cars 2" brings more than bland racing to the table. There's a four-player multiplayer mode that can satisfy an entire family of wannabe spy racers and a handful of other endearing modes. One has you circling the track while looking for batteries to maintain your shield; another requires you to continually kill enemies to restock an ever-draining clock. <br/> <br/>  
It all adds up to a solid kart racer. "Cars 2" doesn't always capture the feeling of Pixar's spy-car series, but despite that, it'll still get the kids in your house revved up. <br/> <br/>
