			<span class="title">OFFICIAL XBOX MAGAZINE</span><br/> <br/>     
<span class="date">June 21, 2011</span><br/> <br/> 
<span class="copy">By Andrew Hayward</span><br/> <br/>     
<span class="copy">Changing focus can be risky business for sequels, but it pays off in Cars 2: The Video Game. Whereas the first game (like its cinematic counterpart) was all about cute talking cars racing and becoming pals, this new version enters the dramatic realm of international espionage — and the new tone and perspective help make Cars 2 better than not only the first movie tie-in, but the franchise’s other installments, too. <br/> <br/>  
Cars 2 trades the first game’s open-world concept — also employed (with diminishing returns) in the subsequent Cars: Race-o-Rama and Cars: Mater-National — for a new action-oriented approach that feels like a kid-friendly cross between Split/Second and Blur. You’ll pick up missiles and machineguns in frantic races toward the finish line, all the while discovering clever shortcuts, pulling off mid-air tricks, and even driving backward or on two wheels. <br/> <br/>  
The game hosts a solid variety of event types, including arena-style car-combat battles and a mode where you’ll stay alive by blasting opponents to pieces. With exciting racing action, 20-plus worldwide tracks, and a large number of cars — plus the ability to tackle any event with four local players — this movie tie-in proves surprisingly robust. Even the Achievements are pretty good, giving Gamerscore-grubbers of all ages genuine incentive to replay completed missions.  <br/> <br/>  
Cars 2 isn’t quite gripping or original enough to top the more notable racers that inspired it, and regrettably, its aimless career mode and lack of online play are slight downers. But kids’ games and movie games are rarely this polished and entertaining, so we commend Disney for doing this one right.
